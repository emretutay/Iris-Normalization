A project in MATLAB that detects the boundaries of Iris and Pupil parts of the eye from an eye image using Circular Hough Transform, then unwraps the iris from the image and normalizes the iris by transforming it to polar coordinates using Daugman Rubber Sheet Model.
The normalized iris can be used to Iris Recognition process easier.
